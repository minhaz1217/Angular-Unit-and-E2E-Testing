## Angular Unit and E2E testing.

Here I follow this course [Angular Testing Course](https://angular-university.io/course/angular-testing-course).

I will try my best to maintain the codes shown in this course, and put them each in their separate branch.

I start a branch before I start watching a video and at the end of the video, I commit the changes and push and merge the branch to master.

So if you want to say watch the video and continue doing from from 24th video. 
Then you will have to checkout the branch of the 23rd video. Because this branch will have the code for end of the 23rd and start of the 24th video.

# Steps for using
### At first clone the repo using
```
git clone https://github.com/minhaz1217/Angular-Unit-and-E2E-Testing.git

cd Angular-Unit-and-E2E-Testing

```
git checkout Section-6_The-Single-Data-Observable-Pattern/38_Refactoring-an-Angular-Reactive-Application-to-OnPush-Change-Detection
```
