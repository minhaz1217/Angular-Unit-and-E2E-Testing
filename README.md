## Angular Unit and E2E testing.

Here I follow this course [Angular Testing Course](https://angular-university.io/course/angular-testing-course).

I will try my best to maintain the codes shown in this course, and put them each in their separate branch.

# Installation pre-requisites

Please install Node 18 Long Term Support Edition (LTE).

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli 


# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/minhaz1217/Angular-Unit-and-E2E-Testing.git
    
This repository is made of several separate npm modules, that are installable separately. For example, to run the au-input module, we can do the following:
    
    cd Angular-Unit-and-E2E-Testing
    npm install

Its also possible to install the modules as usual using npm:

    npm install 

# To Run the Development Backend Server

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start 

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
